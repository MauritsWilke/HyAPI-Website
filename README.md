# Front End for the HyAPI

Hi! This will be v1 of the HyAPI front-end side, this is my first time using svelte so don't expect too much yet.
This will be a v1 learning site where I just experiment with the basics of svelte and try to make it something nice.
Design isn't my strongest point so please dont be too harsh :)

The site will _probably_ be hosted on github pages, but later itll be added to the hyapi website once im satisfied
